# Gemini-Powered Chatbot

This project is final assignment for AI Productivity and AI API Integration for Developers course by Hacktiv8. A full-stack, real-time chatbot that allows users to have a conversation with a Gemini-powered AI model. The application supports not only text-based chat but also the ability to upload various file types, including images, documents, and audio, for the AI to process.
